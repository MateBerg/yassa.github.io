1.5kg chicken
1hr 20mins
 - cut sweet potato, carrots and parsnips in big chunks, line on tray/foil
 - cut lemon in half + stuff in chicken cavity
 - lots of salt+pepper in cavity
 - rub butter all over chicken and vegetables, season again
 - parsnips and sweet potato taste great if cooked for full chicken time

roast potatoes
- parboil small cut potatoes in pan with lid with 1/4 tsp of baking soda (water boiling first)
- put baking tray in oven for potatoes and add butter/fat to tray
  - don't add foil to this fat tray, as the potatoes will stick to it
- transfer potatoes to dish after 20mins (!) should be soft
- put fat back in potato pan, get fat really hot
- transfer potatoes back to fat and shake a lot so they're really mushed up
- put on tray, cover in olive oil, salt, and rosemary, bake for remaining time

- turn potatoes every 20mins, don't let them burn
- add saussages to chicken disk at this time
