<h2 id="phds">Research at Durham</h2>
<p>Durham is a beautiful historic cathedral city situated in the north-east of England, where the University has long traditions but modern values. The deparment of Computer Science has a wonderful friendly and supportive culture with access to exceptional resources such as a world class supercomputer, Hamilton, and we have access to the new EPSRC Tier 2 National HPC facility (“BEDE”) hosted in Durham and operated by ARC on behalf of the N8 Universities. The department of Computer Science boasts an impressive new £40 million building (finished in 2020) with outstanding research facilities including a NVIDIA Compute Center (recently upgraded with a £150,000 node of GPUs) configured for Deep Learning.</p>

<h2 id="phds">PhD Positions</h2>
<p>Candidates looking to join the group for a PhD should have a degee in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science or a related field. You must provide clear evidence of mathematical ability (statistics or geometry) and preferably programming experience with Python.</p>
<p>Please read the <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/science.faculty/postgraduatefunding/">science faculty guidelines for securing postgraduate funding</a>. There are a number of ways to secure funding including Durham Doctoral Studentships (DDS) which are fully-funded 3.5 year PhD studentships. These are competitive and require a CV, two references, a research proposal and evidence of good English language ability. Please contact me in November or December to discuss a proposal. </p>
<p>Students can also receive scholarships from their home countries, for example from China (<a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/pg/finance/funding/bursaries/scholarships/csc/">CSC</a>), Singapore (<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/national-science-scholarship-phd">NSS</a>), Hong Kong residents (<a href="https://croucher.org.hk/funding/study_awards/scholarships">Croucher</a>), Commonwealth countries (<a href="https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/about-us/scholarships/">CS</a>), Mexico (<a href="https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/">CONACYT</a>), and the USA (<a href="http://www.fulbright.org.uk/going-to-the-uk/postgraduate-student-awards/awards-available/durham-university">Fulbright</a>). It is worth Googling for such opportunities from your home country.</p>
<p>If you are self-funded or have secured external funding, please send me your CV and a brief research proposal with evidence of your mathematical ability to <a href="mailto:christopher.g.willcocks@durham.ac.uk">christopher.g.willcocks@durham.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<h2 id="phds">Visiting Scholars</h2>
<p>If you are interested in a visiting position, either as an academic scholar or as a PhD student, please email me as above. I am interested in candidates with strong mathematical ability in statistics, machine learning, or geometry. Durham has particularly <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/ug/finance/international/living/">low living costs</a>, and our building is designed to be accessible for parents.</p>
